## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

The following are all that i learnt from this challeng:

- Using CSS flexbox flex wrap property to wrap flex rows on small screens and then remove the wrap proprty to allow the normal flex behaviour on medium and large screens. with this, making the challenge responsive became a little easy.

- JavaScript documentElement property. This property allowed me to add and remove the **theme-dark** class to the root **(html)** element of the page very easy. With just 4 lines of code I was able to toggle between dark mode and light mode. Nice!!

```js
const toggle = document.querySelector('#themeToggle');

toggle.addEventListener('change', function() {
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle('theme-dark');
});
```

### Continued development

In the future I will like:

1. To fetch the Social Media data from an endpoint.
2. Save current theme settings to local storage.

### Useful resources

I really liked how easy it made switching between dark and light themes.
